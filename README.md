# About

A sample repository for [FlutterKaigi 2021](https://flutterkaigi.jp/#/).

This is one of the packages that will be included in [project_2021](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_project_2021).
This is a reference code to explain the management of Flutter's private plugins and packages, and the microservice of the UI.

# Description

Load [plugin_c](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_c_2021) and [plugin_d](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_d_2021), and display tab screen.

To check the operation of plugin_c alone, a Flutter application is prepared in the example directory.
This sample application relies on [plugin_a](https://github.com/koji-1009/kaigi_plugin_a_2021) to get the theme.
